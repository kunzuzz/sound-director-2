## Organization Rules Applied

1. Russian scene names have been translated to English
2. For scenes with multiple segments (e.g., Scene 2, Scene 3), subdirectories were created for each segment
3. Where multiple files existed in a single folder, only the first one was retained according to the specification
4. All audio files maintain their original content while receiving appropriately translated filenames

## File Count

Total audio files: 39
